This is an html project designed to imrpove my html chops.

The goal is to create a simple recipie website with links, images
and text content.

I will also make sure to follow proper file conventions, git commit
conventions, and semantic html guidelines.


Conclusion/post summary:

Extensive practice with html. Confident in the basic uses of the language.

Gained experience with Git commands, creating Github repository's, and the
'add, commit, push' Git workflow.
